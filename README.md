    Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
</h1
<p> </p>

### General info 
My implementation of algorithm, that converts AST objects to HTML strings. Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) is an object representation of certain piece of HTML.
### Technologies
Implementation created with Jest (as testing framework) and babel-jest (to enable the use of ES6 Modules with Jest framework). During this project, I mainly wanted to focus on single-responsibility principle within the algorithm. In order to achieve that, I created more functions, where each one is having one job.
